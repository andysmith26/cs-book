## Brief
Build a simplified Asteroids game in Java/Greenfoot demonstrating classes/objects, inheritance, conditionals, and iteration.

## Preflight
Tick the checklist above. Review any skills youâ€™re unsure about.

## Build Steps
1. Design your class diagram (Ship, Asteroid, Bullet, World).
2. Implement base behaviors; then extend with specialized subclasses.
3. Add game loop rules (spawn, collide, score).

## Rubric (skill-linked)
- Inheritance hierarchy designed and used (`oop/inheritance` L2)
- Loop logic drives game reliably (`programming/iteration` L2)
- Class responsibilities clear (`oop/classes-objects` L2)

## Submit
- GitHub repo link, short demo video, one-page poster.
