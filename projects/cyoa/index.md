## Brief
Create a multi-page branching narrative website with clear navigation and no dead ends.

## Preflight
Sketch your link graph. Ensure every page has a way *forward* and *back*.

## Build Steps
1. `index.html` introduces the story and choices.
2. Create branch pages; ensure consistent nav/breadcrumbs.
3. Validate HTML; basic responsive CSS.

## Rubric (skill-linked)
- Semantic HTML and valid structure (`web/html-basics` L1)
- Navigable link graph (`web/hyperlink-graphs` L1)

## Submit
- GitHub Pages URL.
