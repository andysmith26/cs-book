            <h2 class="display-4">Project Specifications</h2>
	    Your project consists of three deliverables:
	    <div class="tiered-list">
            <ol>
              <li>An Asteroids game that runs within Greenfoot.
              <ol>
		<li>The game includes all of the elements mentioned in 4 packets (except the 2-player implementation, which is optional).</li>
                <li>The game includes at least one original improvement, designed and implemented by you with minimal troubleshooting assistance.</li>
              </ol>
	      </li>
	      <li>A 15-30 second video on YouTube that shows a screen-recording of you playing your Asteroids game.
		<ol>
		  <li>The video privacy is set to <i>unlisted</i> or <i>public</i>.</li>
		  <li>A link to the video is on the README page of the class repo, together with your first name.</li>
		</ol>
	      </li>
	      <li>A poster meeting the following requirements.
		<ol>
		  <li>The poster is good-looking and polished, and its size is minimum 11x17 and maximum 24x36.</li>
		  <li>The poster includes screenshots (at least 2, but not covering more than 50% of the poster) illustrating the improvement you made to the game.</li>
	          <li>Those screenshots are annotated to explain what they illustrate and to identify the purpose of your improvement.</li>
		  <li>The poster includes a paragraph (max 150 words) describing the incremental development process of your improvement.</li>
		  <li>That paragraph focuses on one distinct point in that process where you encountered a difficulty (or opportunity) and how it was resolved (or incorporated).</li>
		  <li>The poster includes a code segment (4-20 lines) from the Asteroids project (not necessarily from your improvement) that implements one of the concepts covered in the midterm review guide.</li>
		  <li>That code segment is annotated to illustrate how it implements the main ideas of the selected concept, and how it contributes to the overall functioning of the game.</li>
		</ol>

          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="display-4">Step 1: Guided Coding</h2>

            <p>
              Complete all the coding described in the 4 Asteroids packets (except the 2-player implementation mentioned in Packet 3 Part 5, which is optional).
	    </p>
	    <p>There are printed copies of the packets available in the classroom and digital copies available here: (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WOi5vwDU_F63itkudRDL6k9wGbj3Mr7z">Packet 1</a>) (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g3-tnVoudLbzzQ4qq75qVv2JtyRomVWv">Packet 2</a>) (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uB3Us39ICrzeKHkhVJQqlJshBXDC0xrV">Packet 3</a>) (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11RYEFJUdpcrv9Sc4Xo1pJ_r8ZpZ0XqYu">Packet 4</a>)
            </p>
	    <p>
	      You'll find the starter code <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uOAZrrwme8-jUFQuSdbYJ8T7S2MJYwDj">linked here</a>, and an editable tips and tricks <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oT_hc_FNrMZXozmbI1w47V2Ta-9Veqd5EWQ08Awxtz0/edit">linked here</a>

          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="display-4">Step 2: Original Improvement</h2>
	    <p>Make one original improvement to the game. (ie. welcome screen, or extra ship functionality, or...)</p>
	    <p>If you work with somebody on this part, your original improvement must be substantially different than your partner's. This means it must be *your* improvement. But if you are stuck or need troubleshooting support, feel free to talk it out with someone.</p>
          </div>
<br>
          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="display-4">Step 3: YouTube Video</h2>
	    <p>Record 15-30 seconds of your screen while playing the Asteroids game. You can do this however you want, but you must publish the video on YouTube. Instructions for a simple way to do this (with your school account, directly in YouTube) are <a href="https://www.labnol.org/software/create-youtube-screencast/27936/">here</a>.</p>
	    <p>After it is published, make sure the privacy setting for your video is either 'Unlisted' or 'Public'.</p>
	    <p>Now you need to share your video on our class Asteroids repo. To do this, go the the WoodstockCS repo Asteroids (<a href="https://github.com/woodstockcs/Asteroids">linked here</a>). <b>Don't make a fork of this repo. You're going to edit the class repo directly.</b></p>
	    <p>In order to edit this repo, you need to accept an invitation from Mr. Smith to be part of the GitHub team called '1718-CSA', which came to your email inbox on Jan 1. After accepting this invitation, go to the repo and put the <code>README.md</code> file in edit mode and add a line like this: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>[Andy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja9UeCypJNw&t=2m10s)</code><br>which is called 'Markdown code' and after you commit that change, it will look like this: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja9UeCypJNw&t=2m10s">Andy</a>
	    </p>
	    <p>After you commit the change to the <code>README.md</code> page, view the main repo page again and check that your link works.</p>

          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="display-4">Step 4: Poster</h2>
            <p>Read the Specifications above for detailed requirements related to the Poster part of this project. Don't wait until the last minute to ask questions.</p>
          </div>
<br>
          <div class="section">
            <h2 class="display-4">Definition of Done</h2>
            <p>
              You are done when:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You have a fully functioning, polished-looking Asteroids game which you can run from within Greenfoot, and that game incorporates all of the requirements mentioned in the Specifications above.
              </li>
	      <li>
		The main page of the class Asteroids repo (<a href="https://github.com/woodstockcs/Asteroids">linked here</a>) contains a link to your YouTube video, which meets all of the requirements mentioned in the Specifications above.
	      </li>
              <li>
                You have a poster on hand in Mr. Smith's classroom, which meets all of the requirements mentioned in the Specifications above.
              </li>
            </ul>
