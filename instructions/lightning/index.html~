            <p>
              One way to simulate lightning is with a random walk. In this assignment you will create a program that uses a random walk to seemingly shoot lightning from one side of the screen to the other every time the mouse is pressed. 
            </p>
            <table class="table">
              <tr>
                <th>
                  Sample program
                </th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <canvas data-processing-sources="/assets/sketches/Lightning_Smith_Basic/Lightning_Smith_Basic.pde"></canvas>
		  <br>
		  <center>
		    <em>Click in the box to create more lightning.</em>
                </td>

              You may choose to start from scratch or use the <a href="https://github.com/woodstockcs/LegoAd/blob/master/LegoAd.pde">starter code in the assignment repo</a> as a starting point.

              <li>Background color is not white.</li>
              <li>The drawing canvas should be around 900x600, but adjust as needed for your project.</li>
              <li>Each character should be made out of rectangles, but feel free to add in more details with other shapes (like Maggie's pacifier -- an ellipse).</li>
              <li>At least three different fill colors should be used for your ad.</li>
              <li>Your ad must consist of a minimum of three characters.</li>

You may find the PowerPoint sides 142 to 170 of the apjava1.pptx presentation and the Math.random worksheet helpful. Here are some steps to get you started:

Start by forking this repository.
Open the Lightning.pde file. You'll need to add some code At the top of the program, declare 4 int variables startX, startY, endX and endY. Initialize startX to 0, startY to 150, endX to 0 and endY to 150
void setup() needs to set the strokeWeight() and background() of your applet
void draw() needs to do two things:
-set the stroke()color of the lightning bolt to some random value using Math.random()
-a while loop that repeats the following until the endX is off the screen:
set endX to startX plus a random integer from 0 to 9
set endY to startY plus a random integer from -9 to 9
draw a line() with endpoints startX,startY,endX,endY
set startX equal to endX
set startY equal to endY
void mousePressed() needs to set startX,startY,endX,endY back to their original values.
You will need to modify index.html to customize your website with it's own title, headline and footer. When you are happy with your program, push your finished project up to GitHub
The final step is to submit the URL for your website to google classroom. Don't hesitate to ask for help if your aren't sure how something is suppose to work.
Program requirements

Your program needs to create a random walk using Math.random() for all random numbers in the assignment. Other than that, your lightning program doesn't have to work or look like any other. Have fun and be creative!

            <h2 class="display-4">Definition of Done</h2>
            <p>
              You are done when:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You have a runnable sketch on your laptop.
              </li>
              <li>
                That sketch includes all the characters from one of the ad images linked in "Step 1" above.
              </li>
              <li>
                The characters start at different corners of the sketch and move towards the center.
              </li>
              <li>
                The characters stop moving when they are arranged as shown in the original ad image.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each part of your code has comments so that someone else can understand it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Note that the Definition of Done does not include any posting online or other submission of your final product. We will do this together in class.</em></p>
